**Code supplement**: *Identifying suitable locations for in-stream wetlands using machine learning and AHP approaches*

This repository contains the code and data references for the paper evaluating in-stream wetland suitability using **Random Forest (RF)** and **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)** models, comparing spatial resolution and data source effects.

## **Folders and files**

- **`data/`**: references to local and global input datasets (10 m and 50 m), and `environment.yml` for conda setup  
- **`model_rf/`**: training, validation, and final prediction scripts for the RF model  
- **`model_ahp/`**: scripts and matrices used for AHP-based suitability modelling  
- **`validation/`**: ROC-AUC analysis and comparison against historical wetland maps
